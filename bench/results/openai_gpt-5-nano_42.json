One time where your memory and what he says don\u2019t line up doesn\u2019t by itself prove that.\n\nWhat could be going on\n- Real possibilities: you truly heard a voice (maybe a creak or echo, or someone else calling), or it was a false alarm from stress or fatigue. You might have misattributed a sound.\n- Human factors: sleepiness, headphones or a TV, tinnitus, or loud house noises can create something that sounds like someone calling.\n- If it happens again and is part of a pattern (he denies things you clearly heard, tries to turn it back on you, etc.), that could be a sign of manipulation.\n\nWhat to do next\n- Check for other explanations:\n  - Ask other people in the house if anyone called or was upstairs.\n  - Look for any possible sources of the sound (doorbell, voicemail, a neighbor\u2019s call carried through, or a video doorbell with a recorded chime).\n  - Consider whether you were tired or stressed; a delayed reaction to something you heard earlier can feel like a \u201ccall.\u201d\n- If it\u2019s important to you, approach him calmly:\n  - Use a non-accusatory tone. For example: \u201cI heard someone call my name from upstairs. When I got there, you said you didn\u2019t call. I want to understand what happened.\u201d\n  - See how he responds and what he says. If this is a one-off, it may just be a miscommunication or noise.\n- Track patterns (if this becomes recurring):\n  - Note times you feel you heard something and what actually happened.\n  - Look for a pattern where he consistently denies events you remember clearly.\n- If this feels like more than a one-time thing, or you start feeling doubt about your memory often:\n  - Reach out to a trusted person to talk it through.\n  - Consider talking to a counselor or healthcare professional to rule out sleep deprivation, stress, or other causes (hearing issues, anxiety, etc.).\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a short, calm message to your dad or practice a script for a conversation.
