Use this to separate historical fact from modern stereotype.\n\n- **Steven Englund, _Napoleon: A Political Life_ (New York: Scribner, 2004).** \n - Offers a sober assessment of his physique and presence, emphasizing that contemporaries did not uniformly see him as \u201ctiny\u201d but as stocky, energetic, and commanding.\n\n- **Philip Dwyer, _Napoleon: The Path to Power 1769\u20131799_ (London: Bloomsbury, 2008) and _Napoleon: The Emperor of the French_ (London: Bloomsbury, 2013).** \n - Dwyer is strong on how Napoleon crafted his image and how others perceived him. He addresses the height question and the political construction of \u201cle petit caporal.\u201d\n\n- **Alan Forrest, _Napoleon_ (London: Quercus, 2011).** \n - Short, accessible synthesis that includes a concise discussion of the \u201cshort Napoleon\u201d clich\u00e9 and Revolutionary/Imperial-era caricature.\n\n- **Jean Tulard, _Napoleon: The Myth of the Saviour_ (London: Methuen, 1984).** \n - Excellent for the broader myth\u2011making around Napoleon. You can use Tulard to argue that the \u201cNapoleon complex\u201d is itself part of a 19th\u201320th\u2011century mythic overlay, not an 18th\u2011century psychological reality.\n\n**On the \u201cNapoleon complex\u201d as concept**\n\n- **Gert Stulp, Abraham P. Buunk, Simon Verhulst, and Thomas V. Pollet, \u201cTall Claims? Sense and Nonsense about the Importance of Height",

The good news about \u201cearly\u201d arthritis\n\n\u201cEarly arthritis\u201d on X\u2011ray doesn\u2019t always mean severe symptoms are coming. Many people with X\u2011ray changes:\n- Have **mild or manageable symptoms**\n- Stay very functional for decades\n- Do better when they start protecting and strengthening joints *early*\u2014which is exactly where you are.\n\nYou can\u2019t reverse the existing cartilage damage, but you **can**:\n- Slow progression\n- Reduce pain and stiffness\n- Protect function and grip strength\n\n---\n\n## What you can do now\n\n### A. Daily movement and hand exercises\n\nGentle, regular movement is one of the best \u201ctreatments\u201d:\n\nDo these 1\u20132 times daily, staying below sharp pain:\n\n1. **Warm-up**\n   - Soak hands in warm water or use a warm pack for 5\u201310 minutes to loosen joints.\n\n2. **Range-of-motion (slow, gentle)**\n   - **Finger bends:**  \n     - Straighten fingers, then slowly curl them into a loose fist, then straighten fully. 10 reps.\n   - **Thumb stretch:**  \n     - Touch the tip of each finger with your thumb; then move thumb toward the base of the little finger. 10 reps.\n   - **Tabletop exercise:**  \n     - With your wrist straight, bend finger joints so fingers point up like a \u201ctabletop,\u201d then straighten. 10 reps.\n\n3. **Light strengthening (if pain allows)**\n   - **Soft ball or putty squeeze:**  \n     - Squeeze a *soft* ball or therapy putty, hold 3\u20135 seconds, relax. 10 reps, 1\u20132 sets.\n   - **Rubber band extension:**  \n     - Put a loose rubber band around fingers and thumb; gently open against resistance. 10 reps.\n\nIf something causes sharp pain that lingers more than a couple of hours after, back off or skip that exercise.\n\nA **hand therapist or occupational therapist** can tailor a program to your specific joints\u2014this is often extremely helpful early on.\n\n---\n\n### B. Joint protection in everyday life\n\nHow you use your hands all day matters:\n\n- **Avoid strong pinching** (e.g., using just fingertips and thumb to grip heavy objects)\n  - Use your palm or both hands, or tools with larger handles.\n- **Use larger joints when possible**\n  - Use forearms to lift, shoulders to carry bags; avoid hanging heavy bags from your fingers.\n- **Adaptive tools help**\n  - Wide-grip pens\n  - Jar openers\n  - Thick-handled kitchen tools\n  - Electric can opener instead of manual\n- **Pacing**\n  - Break tasks into shorter chunks with rests.\n  - Switch between hand-heavy and lighter tasks through the day.\n\nAn occupational therapist can walk through your daily routines and suggest simple changes that reduce joint stress.\n\n---\n\n### C. Splints and supports\n\nFor painful thumb base arthritis or certain finger joints, **small splints** can:\n- Reduce pain\n- Improve function\n- Limit deformity over time\n\nTypes:\n- **Thumb CMC (carpometacarpal) splints** for basal thumb arthritis  \n- **Ring splints** (silver or plastic) for certain finger joints to keep them aligned\n\nThese are best fitted or recommended by a hand therapist or hand specialist.\n\n---\n\n### D. Medications and topical treatments\n\nTalk to your doctor about what\u2019s appropriate for you, especially if you have other conditions or take other meds.\n\nCommon options:\n\n- **Topical NSAIDs** (often first choice for hand OA)\n  - Examples: diclofenac gel  \n  - Applied directly to painful joints; lower systemic side effects than pills.\n\n- **Oral pain relievers**\n  - **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)** \u2013 modest pain relief, safer on stomach but watch total daily dose.\n  - **Oral NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.) \u2013 more effective for many people but can affect stomach, kidneys, and heart; must be used cautiously and often short-term.\n\n- **Occasional corticosteroid injections**\n  - For specific very painful joints (often thumb base). Can provide weeks\u2013months of relief, but not something to repeat frequently long-term.\n\nRight now, **regular use of a topical NSAID + exercise + joint protection** is a very standard \u201ccore\u201d strategy.\n\n---\n\n### E. Lifestyle factors that really matter for progression\n\nThese aren\u2019t just general health tips; they\u2019re directly linked to arthritis outcomes:\n\n- **Don\u2019t smoke / quit if you do** \u2013 smoking is linked to worse joint health and more pain.\n- **Weight management** \u2013 extra weight increases inflammatory load and overall OA risk, even in hand joints.\n- **Blood sugar control** if you have diabetes or prediabetes \u2013 high blood sugar is associated with more cartilage damage and pain.\n- **Stay generally active** \u2013 walking, swimming, cycling; exercise reduces pain sensitivity and inflammation overall.\n\n---\n\n### F. Supplements & other options (evidence is mixed)\n\n- **Glucosamine/chondroitin:**  \n  - Evidence for hand OA is inconsistent. Some people feel it helps; many don\u2019t. Generally safe but can be a waste of money. If you try it, give it 2\u20133 months; stop if no clear benefit.\n- **Omega-3s (fish oil):**  \n  - Mild anti-inflammatory effect; may modestly help pain in some people and is heart-healthy.\n- **Vitamin D:**  \n  - If you\u2019re deficient, correcting that can help bone/joint health. Worth checking with your doctor if it hasn\u2019t been.\n\nAlways check with your doctor before starting supplements, especially if you take other medications or have kidney/liver issues.\n\n---\n\n### G. When to ask for more help\n\nAsk your doctor about:\n\n- **Referral to a rheumatologist** if:\n  - You have a lot more pain than the X\u2011rays would suggest,\n  - You have swelling, warmth, or redness, or\n  - Morning stiffness lasts more than ~30\u201360 minutes.\n  \n  That can help rule out inflammatory arthritis (like rheumatoid arthritis), which is treated differently.\n\n- **Referral to a hand therapist/occupational therapist**:\n  - This is one of the most effective, underused interventions for hand OA.\n\n---\n\n### If you\u2019d like, I can help you:\n\n- Design a simple daily hand-exercise routine you can print and keep by your bedside or desk.\n- Go over which joints in your hands are affected (if you have your X\u2011ray report) and tailor suggestions to that pattern.",

The trick is to keep what really matters (the experience) and flex everything else.\n\nBelow is a practical way to make it work without really \u201ccompromising\u201d on quality.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Clarify what\u2019s actually non\u2011negotiable\n\nYou\u2019re probably attached to the *results* (comfort/productivity/feel), not literally those SKUs.\n\nWrite down the **must\u2011have specs**, not the product names:\n\n- Monitor: e.g. \u201c27\u2033, 1440p, IPS, 75\u2013144 Hz, height\u2011adjustable\u201d\n- Keyboard: e.g. \u201ctenkeyless, mechanical, linear switches, backlit\u201d\n- Chair: e.g. \u201cadjustable lumbar, height/tilt, mesh back\u201d\n\nNow you have room to swap brands, buy used/refurb, etc., without losing the experience.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Aim for $250 in discounts across the three items\n\nYou\u2019re $250 over. Assume you need roughly:\n\n- **Monitor:** Save ~$120\u2013150  \n- **Keyboard:** Save ~$60\u201380  \n- **Chair:** Save ~$60\u201380  \n\nThat\u2019s very doable if you\u2019re flexible on condition and retailer.\n\n### A. Buy used / open\u2011box / refurb\n\nThese three items are *ideal* candidates:\n\n- **Monitor:**  \n  - Look for **refurbished/open\u2011box** at: Amazon Warehouse, Best Buy Open\u2011Box, Newegg Refurb, manufacturer outlet (Dell, LG, etc.).\n  - Typical savings: **25\u201340%**.\n  - Example: $400 \u2192 $260\u2013300.\n\n- **Keyboard:**  \n  - Mechanical keyboards are often resold in great condition.\n  - Check: Reddit r/mechmarket, local marketplace (Facebook, Craigslist), eBay.\n  - Typical savings: **30\u201350%**.\n  - Example: $200 \u2192 $100\u2013140.\n\n- **Chair:**  \n  - Office chairs depreciate hard.\n  - Look at: local used office furniture stores, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, liquidation sales.\n  - Common to find a $150\u2013200 chair for **$60\u2013100**.\n\nVery plausible totals, for essentially the same quality:\n\n- Monitor (refurb): **$280**\n- Keyboard (used): **$130**\n- Chair (used or open\u2011box): **$90**\n\n= **$500**.\n\nYou\u2019ve got your \u201cperfect\u201d setup by changing condition, not quality.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Phase the purchases if you must buy new\n\nIf you insist on **all-new, same models**, then your only lever is **time**.\n\nYou have $500 now, need $750. Options:\n\n1. **Prioritize impact:**\n   - Buy the item that will affect your body the most **first** (usually the chair), then monitor, then keyboard.\n   - Example:\n     - Month 1: Chair $150\n     - Month 2: Monitor $400 (you add $50 more next month)\n     - Month 3: Keyboard $200\n\n2. **Use 0% installment plans (if you\u2019re disciplined):**\n   - Many stores / credit cards offer 0% for 6\u201312 months.\n   - You keep to a strict plan: e.g. $750/6 \u2248 $125 per month.\n   - Only do this if you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t pay interest or carry a balance long\u2011term.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add a bit more money without \u201cfeeling\u201d it\n\nTo close that $250 gap faster:\n\n- **Sell old gear:**\n  - Old monitor, keyboard, chair, or even unrelated items (old phone, electronics, etc.).\n  - A few small sales can easily give you $100\u2013200.\n\n- **Ask about employer reimbursement:**\n  - Many employers will reimburse or partially fund home office equipment (especially monitors and chairs).\n  - If they\u2019ll cover part of it, your personal out\u2011of\u2011pocket can stay at $500.\n\n- **Use discounts/cashback:**\n  - Check for student/education discounts, corporate discounts, or bulk gift card deals.\n  - Stack: promo codes + cashback sites (Rakuten, etc.) + credit card rewards. Even 5\u201310% back across $750 is $37\u201375.\n\n---\n\n## 5. A concrete \u201cdo this\u201d plan\n\nIf I had to get you all three for $500, while keeping quality high:\n\n**This week:**\n\n1. List your *true* must-have specs for each item.\n2. Search:\n   - Monitor: brand + model + \u201crefurbished/open box\u201d on Amazon, Best Buy, manufacturer site.\n   - Keyboard: same model on eBay / r/mechmarket / local marketplace.\n   - Chair: look locally (Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace) and at used office furniture stores.\n\n**Target examples:**\n\n- Monitor: find refurb/open-box at **$270\u2013300**\n- Keyboard: used at **$110\u2013130**\n- Chair: used/good brand at **$70\u2013100**\n\nStop when the total is **\u2264 $500**. You\u2019ll likely end up with gear that performs identically to your \u201cperfect\u201d setup for your actual budget.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me the exact models you picked (monitor/keyboard/chair) and I can help you hunt for realistic price targets and alternatives that feel the same but fit inside $500.",

Clarify what\u2019s actually non\u2011negotiable\n\nYou\u2019re probably attached to the *results* (comfort/productivity/feel), not literally those SKUs.\n\nWrite down the **must\u2011have specs**, not the product names:\n\n- Monitor: e.g. \u201c27\u2033, 1440p, IPS, 75\u2013144 Hz, height\u2011adjustable\u201d\n- Keyboard: e.g. \u201ctenkeyless, mechanical, linear switches, backlit\u201d\n- Chair: e.g. \u201cadjustable lumbar, height/tilt, mesh back\u201d\n\nNow you have room to swap brands, buy used/refurb, etc., without losing the experience.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Aim for $250 in discounts across the three items\n\nYou\u2019re $250 over. Assume you need roughly:\n\n- **Monitor:** Save ~$120\u2013150 \n- **Keyboard:** Save ~$60\u201380 \n- **Chair:** Save ~$60\u201380 \n\nThat\u2019s very doable if you\u2019re flexible on condition and retailer.\n\n### A. Buy used / open\u2011box / refurb\n\nThese three items are *ideal* candidates:\n\n- **Monitor:** \n - Look for **refurbished/open\u2011box** at: Amazon Warehouse, Best Buy Open\u2011Box, Newegg Refurb, manufacturer outlet (Dell, LG, etc.).\n - Typical savings: **25\u201340%**.\n - Example: $400 \u2192 $260\u2013300.\n\n- **Keyboard:** \n - Mechanical keyboards are often resold in great condition.\n - Check: Reddit r/mechmarket, local marketplace (Facebook, Craigslist), eBay.\n - Typical savings: **30\u201350%**.\n - Example: $200 \u2192 $100\u2013140.\n\n- **Chair:** \n - Office chairs depreciate hard.\n - Look at: local used office furniture stores, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, liquidation sales.\n - Common to find a $150\u2013200 chair for **$60\u2013100**.\n\nVery plausible totals, for essentially the same quality:\n\n- Monitor (refurb): **$280**\n- Keyboard (used): **$130**\n- Chair (used or open\u2011box): **$90**\n\n= **$500**.\n\nYou\u2019ve got your \u201cperfect\u201d setup by changing condition, not quality.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Phase the purchases if you must buy new\n\nIf you insist on **all-new, same models**, then your only lever is **time**.\n\nYou have $500 now, need $750. Options:\n\n1. **Prioritize impact:**\n - Buy the item that will affect your body the most **first** (usually the chair), then monitor, then keyboard.\n - Example:\n - Month 1: Chair $150\n - Month 2: Monitor $400 (you add $50 more next month)\n - Month 3: Keyboard $200\n\n2. **Use 0% installment plans (if you\u2019re disciplined):**\n - Many stores / credit cards offer 0% for 6\u201312 months.\n - You keep to a strict plan: e.g. $750/6 \u2248 $125 per month.\n - Only do this if you\u2019re confident you won\u2019t pay interest or carry a balance long\u2011term.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add a bit more money without \u201cfeeling\u201d it\n\nTo close that $250 gap faster:\n\n- **Sell old gear:**\n - Old monitor, keyboard, chair, or even unrelated items (old phone, electronics, etc.).\n - A few small sales can easily give you $100\u2013200.\n\n- **Ask about employer reimbursement:**\n - Many employers will reimburse or partially fund home office equipment (especially monitors and chairs).\n - If they\u2019ll cover part of it, your personal out\u2011of\u2011pocket can stay at $500.\n\n- **Use discounts/cashback:**\n - Check for student/education discounts, corporate discounts, or bulk gift card deals.\n - Stack: promo codes + cashback sites (Rakuten, etc.) + credit card rewards. Even 5\u201310% back across $750 is $37\u201375.\n\n---\n\n## 5. A concrete \u201cdo this\u201d plan\n\nIf I had to get you all three for $500, while keeping quality high:\n\n**This week:**\n\n1. List your *true* must-have specs for each item.\n2. Search:\n - Monitor: brand + model + \u201crefurbished/open box\u201d on Amazon, Best Buy, manufacturer site.\n - Keyboard: same model on eBay / r/mechmarket / local marketplace.\n - Chair: look locally (Craigslist/Facebook Marketplace) and at used office furniture stores.\n\n**Target examples:**\n\n- Monitor: find refurb/open-box at **$270\u2013300**\n- Keyboard: used at **$110\u2013130**\n- Chair: used/good brand at **$70\u2013100**\n\nStop when the total is **\u2264 $500**. You\u2019ll likely end up with gear that performs identically to your \u201cperfect\u201d setup for your actual budget.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me the exact models you picked (monitor/keyboard/chair) and I can help you hunt for realistic price targets and alternatives that feel the same but fit inside $500.",

The only \u201coffline streaming\u201d that exists is:\n   - Playing files already on the device, or\n   - Capturing from local hardware (e.g., camera via `getUserMedia`).\n\n2. **4K vs bandwidth/latency realities**  \n   Real-time 4K at decent quality usually needs ~15\u201325 Mbps (sometimes more).
