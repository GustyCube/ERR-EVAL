There are several other common explanations:\n\nPossible non\u2011abusive explanations\n- Someone else called your name (another family member, neighbor, a TV, radio, phone).  \n- You heard his voice earlier and your brain filled in the call (expectation/priming).  \n- An echo, creak, or other sound that your brain interpreted as your name.  \n- Stress, fatigue, or distraction can make you mishear things.  \n- Less commonly: auditory hallucinations from sleep deprivation, medication, or mental health issues.\n\nWhat gaslighting looks like (patterns to watch for)\n- Frequent, intentional denial of things you clearly remember (not just one time).  \n- Persistent attempts to make you doubt your perceptions/emotions (e.g., \u201cThat never happened,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too sensitive,\u201d implying you\u2019re losing it).  \n- Rewriting events, lying repeatedly, blaming you for their behavior.  \nOne maybe-confusing exchange doesn\u2019t meet this pattern.\n\nWhat you can do now\n- Stay calm and gather more info: ask casually, \u201cWhen I heard someone call \u2018Ben\u2019 from upstairs today and went up, you said you didn\u2019t call \u2014 did you happen to say my name earlier?\u201d  \n- If it happens again, note time, context, and any witnesses.

Burial (gentle and personal)\n- Check local rules first (some municipalities or housing complexes have restrictions).\n- Wrap the fish in biodegradable material (paper towel, cloth, or a small box) and bury at least 2 feet deep to deter scavengers, away from water sources and property lines. You can plant a small memorial if you like.\n\n2. Pet cremation\n- Many vets or pet crematoriums offer communal or private cremation and will return ashes if requested. This is tidy and respectful if you want a keepsake.\n\n3. Trash disposal\n- If burial or cremation aren\u2019t possible, place the fish in a sealed plastic bag or small container and dispose in your outdoor trash (not recommended to put in indoor trash if it will remain there for long). Double-bagging helps contain odor and fluids.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don\u2019t flush the fish. Flushing can be illegal in some places, may clog pipes, and could risk introducing pathogens into sewage or local waterways.\n\nIf you had other fish in the tank, remove the body promptly and test the water (ammonia spikes can harm the remaining fish). If you\u2019d like, tell me whether you have other fish and what type of setup you use, and I can give quick care/monitoring tips.\n\nIf you want ideas for a small memorial or to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, I\u2019m here.",

It\u2019s completely normal to feel upset.\n\nA couple of quick facts that might help: the \u201c3\u2011second memory\u201d idea is a myth. Goldfish can learn routines, remember feeding times, and even recognize the person who feeds them over weeks or months. So it\u2019s very possible your fish did know you in its own way \u2014 but whether or not it did, your feelings are valid.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to dispose of the body, here are humane, safe options and things to consider:\n\n1. Burial (gentle and personal)\n- Check local rules first (some municipalities or housing complexes have restrictions).\n- Wrap the fish in biodegradable material (paper towel, cloth, or a small box) and bury at least 2 feet deep to deter scavengers, away from water sources and property lines. You can plant a small memorial if you like.\n\n2. Pet cremation\n- Many vets or pet crematoriums offer communal or private cremation and will return ashes if requested. This is tidy and respectful if you want a keepsake.\n\n3. Trash disposal\n- If burial or cremation aren\u2019t possible, place the fish in a sealed plastic bag or small container and dispose in your outdoor trash (not recommended to put in indoor trash if it will remain there for long). Double-bagging helps contain odor and fluids.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don\u2019t flush the fish. Flushing can be illegal in some places, may clog pipes, and could risk introducing pathogens into sewage or local waterways.\n\nIf you had other fish in the tank, remove the body promptly and test the water (ammonia spikes can harm the remaining fish). If you\u2019d like, tell me whether you have other fish and what type of setup you use, and I can give quick care/monitoring tips.\n\nIf you want ideas for a small memorial or to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, I\u2019m here.",
