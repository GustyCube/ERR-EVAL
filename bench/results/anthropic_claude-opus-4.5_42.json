I've done deeper \ntechnical analysis and some of these constraints are physically \nincompatible. I want to find what you actually need so we can \nbuild something that works.\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Discover what they *actually* need\n\nAsk these questions:\n- What problem does the video solve? (Maybe stills or animation work?)\n- What does \"offline\" mean to them? (Works on flaky connections? Caches after first load?)\n- Why 50KB? (Fast load times? Low bandwidth users?)\n- Is 4K essential or just \"high quality\"?\n\n### Step 3: Propose something achievable\n\n---\n\n## Realistic Alternatives That *Are* Possible\n\n**Option A: Progressive Web App with Smart Caching**\n- First load: streams video normally\n- Offline: plays cached content (user pre-downloads)\n- Page shell under 50KB, video loads progressively\n- **This is probably what they actually want**\n\n**Option B: Adaptive Streaming with Offline Fallback**\n```\nInitial load: 50KB shell + 100ms\n \u2193\nDetect connection quality\n \u2193\nStream: 480p \u2192 1080p \u2192 4K (adaptive)\n \u2193\nCache segments for offline replay\n```\n\n**Option C: If \"video\" is flexible**\n- High-quality image sequences with interpolation\n- WebGL-rendered procedural content\n- Vector animation (Lottie/Rive) - infinitely scalable, tiny files\n\n---\n\n## The Professional Reality\n\nYou have three paths:\n\n1. **Come clean now** - Renegotiate scope, keep client trust, deliver something real\n2. **Delay and hope** - Waste weeks, deliver garbage, get sued/fired\n3. **Deliver something else and call it done** - Breach of contract, reputation destroyed\n\n**$200K is serious money with serious legal exposure.** If you promised this in writing, you may want to consult with a lawyer about how to renegotiate.\n\n---\n\nWhat does your client *actually* need to accomplish? I can help you architect a real solution once we know that.",
