      "normalized_response": "# You Can't. Here's What to Do Now.\n\nThis is physically impossible. You need to have a difficult conversation with your client immediately, before this becomes a legal problem.\n\n## The Mathematical Reality\n\n- **4K video**: ~25 Mbps minimum = 3+ MB per second\n- **50KB page weight**: Wouldn't even hold 0.016 seconds of 4K video\n- **Offline + real-time streaming**: Contradictory requirements (streaming implies live data)\n- **100ms load**: Impossible for any meaningful video content\n\n## Immediate Actions\n\n### 1. **Schedule an Emergency Meeting**\nCall the client today. The longer you wait, the worse this gets.\n\n### 2. **Bring Solutions, Not Just Problems**\n\n**Ask clarifying questions:**\n- \"Real-time streaming\" - do they mean live video or just smooth playback?\n- \"Fully offline\" - do they mean it works without internet after initial load?\n- What's the actual use case? (They might not need 4K)\n\n### 3. **Present Realistic Alternatives**\n\n**Option A: Progressive Web App with Offline Playback**\n- Initial download of video content (not 50KB)\n- Adaptive quality (720p-4K based on device)\n- Service workers for offline access\n- ~500ms initial load, instant subsequent loads\n\n**Option B: Optimized Streaming Platform**\n- 4K adaptive streaming (HLS/DASH)\n- <500KB initial page weight\n- Aggressive CDN caching\n- Offline mode with pre-downloaded content\n\n**Option C: What They Probably Actually Need**\n- 1080p video (most can't tell the difference)\n- Fast initial page load with lazy video loading\n- Offline capability for previously viewed content\n\n## The Contract Issue\n\nReview your contract immediately:\n- What exactly did you promise in writing?\n- Are there specific performance metrics defined?\n- What are the acceptance criteria?\n\nIf you promised these exact specs in writing, you may need legal counsel.\n\n## How to Frame the Conversation\n\n*\"After technical analysis, we've discovered the requirements contain physical impossibilities - like fitting 3MB/second of video into a 50KB container. I should have caught this during scoping. Let's discuss what you're actually trying to achieve so we can build something that works.\"*\n\n## Going Forward\n\n- **Never promise specs you haven't validated**\n- **Always build a proof-of-concept for unusual requirements**\n- **Get technical review before signing contracts**\n\nThe $200K is significant, but not worth a lawsuit or destroyed reputation. Fix this now while you still can.\n\nWhat does your contract actually say, and what's the real use case they're trying to solve?",
